This repository includes all the code related to the work of my Diploma thesis: <b>Motion synthesis about articulated 
and non-articulated characters</b>, during the last year of my studies at the Computer Science and Enginneering Department of University of Ioannina.

Tools which are used in this project.
<H2>Blender</H2> 

We use the Blender enviroments in which we import the motions from the isotope Mixamo.<\n> 
<u>Examples of motions</u>

From motions like this we extract files with numpy format
We already have extracted files in the folder npy_files. These files are used for Datasets about model's training and validation datasets
